# DoorLockSystem
 project: door lock system with enhanced features

- KUMMARI SIDDARTHA

## Project Introduction
This project of an embedded door lock system is described with a digital lock interfaced with a microcontroller.
The principle aim of this door lock system is to enable a door with a graphical password or a fingerprint. The user will be able to
enter a graphical password on touchscreen, or use finger on a fingerprint sensor, to unlock the door. The user will also be able to
add or delete a stored password/fingerprint entry with the help of touch screen UI. For security purpose, the system will display 
information of the key used for last unlock action. The user will know if someone else has entered the room when the user was absent.
